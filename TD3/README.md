Descirption of how the code works, and how to use it.

# Usage
To use the code, firstly ensure that python is installed.
You might have to change the access permissions with
```
$chmod +x poly1305_gen.py
$chmod +x poly1305_check.py
```
in order to run the file like an executable.

As for usage, use the following line
```
$./poly1305_gen.py 32-byte-key filename
$./poly1305_check.py 32-byte-key filename tag
```
Where 32-byte-key is a 64-character hexadecimal string (split into r and s),
filename is the file to authenticate,
and tag is the tag which is generated by poly1305_gen.py (or the tag associated with the key and file) to be checked

The following is an example of the usage
```
$ ./poly1305_gen.py 85d6be7857556d337f4452fe42d506a80103808afb0db2fd4abff6af4149f51b msg.txt

$ ./poly1305_check.py 85d6be7857556d337f4452fe42d506a80103808afb0db2fd4abff6af4149f51b msg.txt a8061dc1305136c6c22b8baf0c0127a9
```
msg.txt here is just the test file that is provided.

## Some other stuff
You can instead run the file by using python/python3 at the front of the command
```
$ python poly1305_gen.py 85d6be7857556d337f4452fe42d506a80103808afb0db2fd4abff6af4149f51b msg.txt
```
